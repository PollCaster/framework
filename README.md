# Base Sepolia Contract Address
[0x4828256e2aD7796528A5Ee0A6378ADa8B159D794](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x4828256e2aD7796528A5Ee0A6378ADa8B159D794)

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2.git
cd scaffold-eth-2
yarn install
```

2. Start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

3. Once the form has been filled out and the Frame link has been generated paste it to ![Farcaster Debug](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/55535804/b237af0c-5027-4849-a5c1-2e31495cccb1). In order for that to work your `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_API_URL` has to be set to something else than a localhost, for exmaple publicly available vercel deployment url.
